# 0.3.0

* **Breaking changes**:
  + For `rust` packages, all the files will be searched inside of the output
    directory (usually `target`) and, if they don't exist, inside the project
    directory. This allows rinstall to correctly get files generated by
    `build.rs` without adding too much clutter in the `install.yml`.
    To force rinstall to get a file in the project directory, use the
    `$PROJECTDIR` placeholder.
* Bugfixes:
  * Always add an ending '/' to directory paths, both in the default ones and
   in the one read from the command line. Fixes #6.

# 0.2.0

* install.yml:
  + Add new `systemd-user-units` key
* **Breaking changes**:
  + Use `XDG_DATA_HOME` as `localstatedir` in non system-wide installations
  + Use `/usr/local/lib/systemd` as systemd_unitsdir instead of
    `/usr/local/lib/systemd/system`
  + `user-config` will be installed as docs in system-wide installations
  + Move default command to an install subcommand
* Add colored output
* Add new `--rust-debug-target` flag
* Small improvements to dry mode and warnings

* Add $PROJECTDIR placeholder for rust projects
* Take multiple packages in `uninstall` command
